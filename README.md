# armsy

arms. they're everywhere. but how do they get there?

they're made, traded, or carried.

let's track some weapon systems?

## SIPRI

sipri has some open access data on very official arms trade deals, can start by mapping that.

could maybe illustrate pass-through states and the like, would look good on a map.

### shippy

could combine with shippy in the long run, wouldn't be all that useful.

### conflict

continuously updated open data on conflicts would be nice. could geolocate zones/participants and pick that out of the sipri data.

would be nice to see weapon buildd-ups like US-\>UKR from 2014 onwards.
